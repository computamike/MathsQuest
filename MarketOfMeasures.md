Puzzle:

“Each brick weighs 2.5 kg. You need 6 bricks to build a wall.”

Puzzle:

📏 Scene 3: The Tailor’s Tent
A tailor needs help measuring cloth:

“I need 1.2 meters of silk, 75 cm of velvet, and 0.5 meters of thread.”

Puzzle:
Convert all measurements to the same unit and find the total length.

✅ Math Focus: Length and unit conversion
✅ Answer: 1.2 m + 0.75 m + 0.5 m = 2.45 meters

🧠 Final Scene: The Estimation Game
The merchant king challenges the players:

“This jar holds between 1 and 2 litres of liquid.
You pour in 500 ml, then 750 ml.
Estimate how much more it can hold.”

✅ Math Focus: Estimation and capacity
✅ Answer: 500 ml + 750 ml = 1250 ml → estimate remaining capacity ≈ 750 ml
