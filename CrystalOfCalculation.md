# 🧭 Adventure Title: The Quest for the Crystal of Calculation
## 🎯 Goal:
Retrieve the magical Crystal of Calculation, stolen by the mischievous goblin Mathgob, who has hidden it deep in the Caverns of Confusion. Along the way, players must solve math puzzles to progress.

## 👧 Recommended Age: 7–11
## 🧮 Maths Focus: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, basic logic, and problem-solving.
## 🧙 Characters (Pre-made or Custom)
Each player chooses a character with a simple stat sheet:


|   | s |   |
|-------|---|---|
| **Name** | (e.g. Lira the Lightning Wizard)|   |
| **HP** | 10 |   |
| **Attack** |  Roll 1d6 + 2|
| **Inventory** | |


# 🗺️ Adventure Outline
Scene 1: The Riddle Bridge
To cross the bridge, the players must solve a riddle from the troll:

“I have three bags of gold. One has 12 coins, one has 8, and one has 5.
I give 7 coins to my brother. How many do I have left?”

# Rules
## 💥 When Does a Player Lose HP?
## You can have players lose 1 or 2 HP when:

- They answer a math puzzle incorrectly (but still get to try again).
- They trigger a trap (like pulling the wrong lever in Scene 2).
- They step on the wrong tile in the Goblin’s Maze.
- They fail a challenge and choose to “take the hit” instead of solving it.
This keeps the stakes real but not punishing.

## ❤️ How to Regain HP
You can also include ways to heal:

- Solving a bonus puzzle correctly.
- Finding a “Healing Potion” in a treasure chest.
- Teamwork moments (e.g. another player helps them and they both gain 1 HP).

## 🧠 Optional Rule: “Math Shield”
Give each player a Math Shield they can use once per game to avoid losing HP if they explain their thinking, even if their answer is wrong. This encourages reasoning and confidence.


✅ Math focus: Addition and subtraction

Scene 2: The Puzzle Door
A stone door blocks the way. It has three levers labeled:

A: 3 × 4
B: 5 + 7
C: 18 ÷ 2
Only one lever opens the door. The others trigger a trap (harmless, but funny — like glitter explosion).

✅ Math focus: Multiplication and division

Scene 3: The Goblin’s Maze
Players must navigate a maze with numbered tiles. They can only step on tiles that are even numbers or multiples of 3.

✅ Math focus: Number patterns and logic

Final Scene: Mathgob’s Challenge
Mathgob appears and offers a deal: solve his final challenge, and he’ll return the Crystal.

“I’m thinking of a number.
It’s more than 10, less than 20.
It’s a multiple of 3.
What is it?”

✅ Math focus: Reasoning and number properties

🎁 Rewards
Crystal of Calculation: Restores balance to the land and gives each hero a “+1 to Maths Confidence” token.
Bonus XP for teamwork and creative thinking.
