# 🧭 Adventure Title: The Quest for the Crystal of Calculation
## 🎯 Goal:
Retrieve the magical Crystal of Calculation, stolen by the mischievous goblin Mathgob, who has hidden it deep in the Caverns of Confusion. Along the way, players must solve math puzzles to progress.

## 👧 Recommended Age: 7–11
## 🧮 Maths Focus: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, basic logic, and problem-solving.
## 🧙 Characters (Pre-made or Custom)
Each player chooses a character with a simple stat sheet:


|   | s |   |
|-------|---|---|
| **Name** | (e.g. Lira the Lightning Wizard)|   |
| **HP** | 10 |   |
| **Attack** |  Roll 1d6 + 2|
| **Inventory** | |

# Rules
## 💥 When Does a Player Lose HP?
## You can have players lose 1 or 2 HP when:

- They answer a math puzzle incorrectly (but still get to try again).
- They trigger a trap (like pulling the wrong lever in Scene 2).
- They step on the wrong tile in the Goblin’s Maze.
- They fail a challenge and choose to “take the hit” instead of solving it.
This keeps the stakes real but not punishing.

## ❤️ How to Regain HP
You can also include ways to heal:

- Solving a bonus puzzle correctly.
- Finding a “Healing Potion” in a treasure chest.
- Teamwork moments (e.g. another player helps them and they both gain 1 HP).

## 🧠 Optional Rule: “Math Shield”
Give each player a Math Shield they can use once per game to avoid losing HP if they explain their thinking, even if their answer is wrong. This encourages reasoning and confidence.


# 🗺️ Adventure Outline
Scene 1: The Riddle Bridge
To cross the bridge, the players must solve a riddle from the troll:

“I had three bags of gold, all shiny and bright,
One held twelve coins, a splendid sight.
One had eight, and one just five,
Together they made my wealth come alive.
But I gave away seven, a generous deed,
To help my brother in his time of need.
Now count what’s left, don’t be misled—
How many coins stay in my stead?”



✅ Math focus: Addition and subtraction

Scene 2: The Puzzle Door
A stone door blocks the way. It has three levers labeled:

A sign is inscribed at the side : 

“Two truths unlock the way ahead,
Their sum must match the number said.
Choose with care, and you’ll be free—
But flip the wrong, and cursed you’ll be.”

A: 40 + 2
B: 21 * 2
C: 34 + 9
Only one lever opens the door. The others trigger a trap (harmless, but funny — like glitter explosion).

✅ Math focus: Multiplication and division

Scene 3: The Goblin’s Maze
Players must navigate a maze with numbered tiles. They can only step on tiles that are even numbers or multiples of 3.

"Warning, adventurer! You now stand at the threshold of the Goblin’s Maze. A perilous path lies before you, paved with numbered stones. But beware—only those who tread wisely shall escape unscathed."

on the archway is the following inscription

*"Numbers mark the path you tread,
Choose with care or join the dead.
Step on evens or threes that divide,
These are safe—so walk with pride.
But stray to odds, the goblins cheer,
One false move and doom is near.
Think, adventurer, before you roam—
Wisdom lights the way to home."*

✅ Math focus: Number patterns and logic

## Scene: Mathgob’s Challenge
(The adventurer enters a dimly lit chamber. A glowing Crystal rests on a pedestal. Mathgob, a mischievous goblin with a crooked grin, leaps into view.)

Intro Speech
"Hee-hee-hee! Welcome, brave adventurer… or should I say, foolish snack?
You want the Crystal? Oh, you do! But Mathgob never gives without a game!
Solve my riddles—three of them—and maybe, just maybe, you’ll leave with your shiny prize.
Fail… and my goblins will dance on your bones! Hee-hee!"

Riddle 1
"First riddle! Listen well, or lose your head!
I’m thinking of a number, can you see?
It’s more than ten, but less than twenty.
It’s in the three times table too—
Can you guess it? I bet you do!"
(Answer: 12, 15, or 18 — choose one as correct.)
Taunts if slow:
"Tick-tock, tick-tock! My goblins are getting hungry!"
"Do you need a counting book, little hero?"
Taunts if wrong:
"Ha! Wrong! That answer smells worse than a troll’s sock!"
"Oops! Did you forget how to count? Hee-hee!"

Riddle 2
"Second riddle! Sharpen your wits!
Two numbers together make a sum,
Add them up and tell me the one.
One is five, the other is seven,
What’s the total? Is it eleven?"
(Answer: 12)
Taunts if slow:
"Hurry up! My goblins are sharpening their forks!"
"Time’s slipping away like gold in a goblin’s pocket!"
Taunts if wrong:
"Oh dear! Numbers aren’t your friends, are they?"
"Wrong again! My goblins are laughing so hard they’re choking!"

Riddle 3
"Final riddle! Fail this, and the Crystal stays mine!
I’m thinking of a number, here’s a clue:
It’s less than ten, but more than two.
Add two more and you’ll make eight—
What’s my number? Don’t be late!"
(Answer: 6)
Taunts if slow:
"Do you need a nap? Or shall I fetch you some goblin fingers to count on?"
"Math waits for no adventurer! Move, or lose!"
Taunts if wrong:
"Ha-ha! Wrong! That’s not even close—did you trip over your own brain?"
"That answer smells worse than a goblin stew!"

### Victory Speech
"Well, well, clever adventurer! You’ve cracked my riddles and twisted my tongue!
The Crystal is yours—take it, before I change my goblin mind!
But remember this day, for Mathgob never forgets…
Next time, my puzzles will be trickier, my laughter louder, and my goblins hungrier!
Go now, hero—before I start asking harder sums!"

### Defeat Speech
"Hee-hee-hee! Wrong, wrong, wrong! The Crystal stays with Mathgob!
You’ve failed the test, and now my goblins will feast on your folly!
Run if you can… but they’re faster than your thinking!"
