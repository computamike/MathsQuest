# 🧠 How to Use Perception Checks for Young Players

🎲 Simple Mechanics
Roll a d20 and say: “Let’s see how good your eyes are today!” If they roll 10 or higher, they notice something special.

You can skip modifiers entirely or say: “You’re really good at spotting things, so you get a +2 bonus!”

🧺 Examples in MathsQuest
|Scenario	|What They Might Discover|
|--|--|
|Searching a room	|A hidden math scroll under the rug|
|Exploring a forest	|A shiny coin stuck in a tree trunk|
|Listening at a door	|Whispered clues about the next puzzle|
|Looking at a puzzle	|A faint symbol that hints at the answer|

🧙‍♂️ Flavorful Framing
Instead of saying “Make a Perception check,” try:
- “Do you want to look around carefully?”
- “Can you spot the hidden number?”
- “Let’s see if your adventurer eyes catch something sneaky!”

🧩 Bonus: Tie It to Math
You could even make Perception checks part of the puzzle:

- “You notice a pattern in the numbers—can you guess what comes next?”
- “You spot a triangle hidden in the wall. How many sides does it have?”
