🔺 Shape Shifter’s Lair Adventure
📘 Introduction
Welcome to Shape Shifter’s Lair! Deep in the twisting tunnels beneath the kingdom lies a mysterious lair ruled by the mischievous Shapeshifter, a creature who can transform into any geometric form.
To retrieve the Gem of Geometry, players must solve puzzles involving 2D and 3D shapes, symmetry, and spatial reasoning.

🧙 Character Guidance
Each player creates a character with:

Name
HP: 10
Attack: Roll 1d6 + 1
Special Skill: e.g. Can rotate or flip one puzzle piece per game
Encourage creativity and teamwork!

🧩 Scene 1: The Hall of Mirrors
Players enter a room filled with magical mirrors.

Puzzle:
Match each shape to its mirror image.
Shapes include: triangle, square, pentagon, and irregular shapes.

✅ Math Focus: Symmetry and reflection

🧱 Scene 2: The Puzzle Wall
A wall blocks the path, covered in tiles of different shapes.

Puzzle:
Identify which tiles are 2D shapes and which are 3D shapes.
Examples:

2D: circle, rectangle, hexagon
3D: sphere, cube, pyramid
✅ Math Focus: Shape classification

🧮 Scene 3: The Transformation Chamber
The Shapeshifter appears briefly and morphs into different forms.

Puzzle:
Describe how a square becomes a cube.
What happens when a triangle is rotated 90°?
Which shapes stay the same when flipped?

✅ Math Focus: Rotation, transformation, and properties of shapes

🧠 Final Scene: The Shapeshifter’s Challenge
The Shapeshifter offers a final challenge:

“I have four shapes: a cube, a cone, a cylinder, and a sphere.
Which one has no edges or vertices?”

Players must identify and explain the properties of each shape.

✅ Math Focus: 3D shape properties
